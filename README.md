# My personal Arch Linux Hyprland dotfiles

- I first used prasanthrangan's install for hyprland base [link here](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots)
- Then I pretty much added on to it, adding personal keybinds and custom waybar
- After that I moved to HyprPanel and themed my zsh with it

# If you do use this, use at your own risk. I can't help with any issues
